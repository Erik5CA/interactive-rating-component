## My process

I started by creating the HTML structure of the component. I then added the CSS styles to make it look like the design. I added the JavaScript code to handle the user interactions and display the rating state.

Finally, I added the logic to show the thank you message when the user submits their rating.

I aplied accessibility best practices to make the component accessible to all users.
